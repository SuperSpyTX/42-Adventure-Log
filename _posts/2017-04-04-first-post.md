# Welcome!

Welcome to my new blog, or the 42 Adventure Log!

This blog has taken ~~a couple hours~~4 hours to make, but finally I got something to work.

I've temporarily redirected the main domain over to here because there is a ton of work that needs to be done in order to make jkrau.se ideal to blog on again (WordPress -> Custom platform or Jekyll)

Regardless, let me annotate about my first day.

So far, it's been the most surreal experience in my life.  The people, the area, the culture, everywhere you look you're literally breathing in it.  Even [Paul Graham says it's another MIT.](https://twitter.com/paulg/status/847844863727087616)

I've met many people the day before (04-02-2017) and just completed Day 00 a little over 12 hours ago, just focused on shell commands and basic unix.  I've been helping others and drawing crowds doing so.  

I almost fell behind on the project but I was able to successfully complete it.  The projects are due 48 hours after they "begin".

As of writing, there was a small change that almost everybody missed in one of the exercises that I just add to add into my code.....yay (sarcasm).

However of course, the day has only begun.  And the memes are just starting up.

{% include image.html path="kernel_panic_mac.jpg" path-detail="kernel_panic_mac.jpg" alt="Oops" %}

{% include image.html path="42_staff_meme.jpg" path-detail="42_staff_meme.jpg" alt="Oops" %}

Meanwhile, I'll keep posting memes and have more updates when we start C.  

Expect updates this Thursday, then every 3 days from there.
